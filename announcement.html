		<strong>Update April 2018!</strong> 
		Geotag functionality should have been <a target="_blank" href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/revision_history#june-1-2017">deprecated on December 1st</a>, 
		but effects are only now being seen. Many channels no longer return results when Channel searching and Topic searching returns fewer results. 
		Thankfully, Location searching does not appear to be impacted.
